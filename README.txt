This folder was made 23 July 2021 by copying R scripts and data from the folder "maps_of_ignorance/millipede_maps_of_ignorance/"

The "millipede_maps_of_ignorance" folder is where I did all the development and computation for chapter 5 of my PhD thesis about spatial under-sampling using Irish millipedes.  That used data obtained from the Irish NBDC, but they have not given permission for that data to be shared with reviewers or made public.  I want to avoid any problems with publishing, so I am going to re-do the computation with data downloaded from GBIF.  The vast majority of the Irish millipede data came from the BMIG recording scheme and is available via GBIF, so I hope this will give similar results to my PhD chapter using the NBDC data.

To run the entire work flow, run the script "main_millipede_maps.R".  

The millipede occurrence data to use is in "/data/GBIF_27_Feb_2021_download/"
